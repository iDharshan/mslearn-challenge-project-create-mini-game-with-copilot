#Program a Rock, Paper, Scissors game where it is the player vs the computer.
#The computerâ€™s answer will be randomly generated, while the program will ask the user for their input.
#This project will better your understanding of while loops and if statements.
#At the end of your game, ask your users if they want to play again.
#At the end of the game display the score of the player and computer.
